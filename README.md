### Fish Cannibal Game
Living conditions in the polluted water are becoming unbearable for harmless fishes, especially, with the existence of sharks. Let's take an action to survive! Grow your fish by eating the others and be afraid of rubbish, which sinks in the water, because it takes your life away. When your fish is the same size as the shark - be ready to attack it and win the game. 
#### How to play 
To move a player in particular direction press arrow keys Right, Left, Up and Down. When you have left only one life, a bonus fish will appear - by eating it you can gain additional life. If you hit the shark before becoming bigger than it - you lose the game.
